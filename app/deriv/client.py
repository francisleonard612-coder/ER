Deriv WebSocket connection layer -- v2.

=====================================================================
WHY THIS CHANGED FROM v1, AND WHAT WAS AND WASN'T PORTED FROM THE
EXTERNAL REFERENCE FILE THIS WAS BASED ON (a "Reversal-System" repo's
deriv/client.py). Both points below were independently verified
against Deriv's own current documentation (developers.deriv.com) before
being adopted -- nothing here was ported on the reference file's word
alone.
=====================================================================

1. DERIV HAS A NEW API GENERATION. Confirmed live against
   developers.deriv.com/llms/*.md: the "New API" (product name
   "Options") uses a REST OTP exchange for WebSocket auth instead of
   the legacy post-connect `{"authorize": token}` message, connects to
   `wss://api.derivws.com/trading/v1/options/ws/{demo|real|public}`
   instead of `wss://ws.derivws.com/websockets/v3`, and renames the
   `proposal` request's `symbol` field to `underlying_symbol`.
   EXPIRYRANGE (our contract type) is confirmed present in the current
   `contract_type` enum. `ticks`/`ticks_history` are NOT affected --
   those calls take the symbol as the *value* of the `ticks`/
   `ticks_history` key itself, not a separately-named field, so no
   rename applies there.

   NOT ported: the reference file's claim of a special 360/minute
   budget shared across proposal/proposal_open_contract/buy/sell.
   Deriv's current docs (api-overview.md) state the limit is 100
   requests/second per connection, generically -- no narrower
   per-message-family budget is documented. `_RateLimiter` below paces
   against the documented number, not the unverified one.

2. A REAL DEADLOCK BUG IN OUR OWN v1 CLIENT, found by cross-checking
   the reference file's rules 1-3 against our code rather than by
   independent testing. v1's `_read_loop()` was the only coroutine
   that read the socket, but on `ConnectionClosed` it called
   `_handle_disconnect()` -- INLINE, in the same coroutine -- which
   then tried to resubscribe via `send()`, which awaits a future that
   only the read loop can resolve. Since the read loop was itself
   blocked inside `_handle_disconnect` at that point, every resubscribe
   after every reconnect would have hung for the full request timeout.
   This was never hit in your logs yet only because the bot never
   reached a successful connect to reconnect FROM (see the 520 issue).
   It would have surfaced the first time a real disconnect happened
   after a real connect.

   Fixed the way the reference file fixes it: the socket reader
   (`_recv_pump`) is its own task, never doing the reconnecting itself.
   A single long-lived `_supervise_pump` task watches it and reconnects
   whenever it exits, for any reason. `_reconnect()` starts the NEW
   pump task on the new socket BEFORE resubscribing anything -- so the
   resubscribe requests always have a live reader able to resolve their
   futures.

Everything else (idempotent single-attempt buy, subscribed rather than
polled settlement, `.state` instead of the removed `.closed` property)
carries the same public method signatures as v1
(`connect`, `close`, `request_proposal`, `buy_contract`,
`subscribe_candles`, `subscribe_contract`, `get_candle_history`,
`balance`) so `run.py` and `app/strategy/engine.py` did not need to
change.

REQUIRES: `httpx` for the REST OTP exchange (`pip install httpx`, or
add it to requirements.txt) when using the default OTP auth mode.
`auth_mode="legacy"` keeps the old connect-then-authorize flow against
`wss://ws.derivws.com/websockets/v3` and needs no extra dependency --
useful as a fallback if OTP auth is ever unavailable for your account.

NEW OPTIONAL ENV VARS (all have safe defaults, nothing else needs to
change to pick them up since DerivClient reads them itself when not
passed explicitly):
  DERIV_API_BASE_URL   default "https://api.derivws.com"
  DERIV_AUTH_MODE      default "otp"  (or "legacy")
  DERIV_ACCOUNT_ID     default unset -- auto-resolved (demo/real) via
                        GET /trading/v1/options/accounts on first
                        connect if not set
