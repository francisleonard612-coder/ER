"""
The mispricing / decision engine (spec sections 11, 12, 23).

Given a candidate's calibrated probability and a *live* Deriv proposal, this
computes payout multiplier, implied probability, edge and EV, and decides
accept/reject with an explicit, logged reason. Nothing here executes trades
or talks to the network -- pure decision logic so it's independently
testable.

    Certainty gating, not time-based pacing: this bot does not wait between
    trades on a cooldown -- it opens whenever a candidate clears every bar
    below, however soon after the last trade, and stays closed however long
    it takes otherwise. "Absolutely sure" is made concrete by three checks
    beyond the original payout/edge/EV/uncertainty ones:

    - model_disagreement: the empirical and block bootstrap Monte Carlo
      methods disagreeing with each other is the model itself signaling
      uncertainty, independent of how confident either estimate looks
      alone.
    - regime_confidence: a low-confidence regime read means we don't
      really know what regime we're in, so no trade should hinge on it --
      checked for every trade, not just ones reaching for a longer duration
      (see the duration ceiling in app/optimizer/candidate.py for that).
    - edge_duration_scaling: longer contracts are noisier for our own
      probability estimate to get right, so the required edge scales up
      with duration rather than staying flat across the whole 2-10 minute
      grid.
